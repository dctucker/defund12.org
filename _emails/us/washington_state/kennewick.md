  Dear Kennewick City Leadership,

  My name is [YOUR NAME] and I am a resident of Kennewick. I am writing to demand that the City Council adopt a budget that prioritizes community well-being and redirects funding away from the police.

  We are in the midst of widespread upheaval over the systemic violence of policing. I will no longer accept empty gestures and suggestions of “reform.” I am demanding that my voice be heard now, and that real change be made to the way this city allocates its resources.

  Rather than prioritize the quality of life for all of Kennewick with a proportional budget, Kennewick chooses to prioritize KPD. According to the 2019-2020 budget flyer, the KPD was allocated a budget of $42,968,000 accounting for 39.4% of Kennewick’s total budget. This money can be spent in other ways that are proven to be more effective in improving community safety and wellness.

  According to the Tri-City Herald, 223 Tri-Citians were homeless as of 2017, however the pandemic’s severe economic consequences has likely caused this number to increase. Support for communities in need is necessary now, more than ever. But instead, Kennewick has chosen to prioritize KPD over funding services for the homeless, many of whom are facing mental health problems and drug addiction.

  I demand that the City Council completely revises the Kennewick budget for the 2020-2021 fiscal year. I demand we redirect police funding to improving mental health response teams, homeless shelters, and funding drug addiction treatment centers. I join the calls of those across the country to defund the police. I demand a budget that supports community well-being, rather than empowers the police forces that tear them apart.

  Public opinion is with me.

  Thank you for your time,
